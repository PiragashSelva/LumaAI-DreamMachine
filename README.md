# LumaAI DreamMachine
 Playing around with LumaAI's DreamMachine, generating videos using text to video and image to video.

The purpose of this project was just to play around with the AI and have fun - seeing what it's capable of as well as exploring its boundaries and limitations. It was quite difficult controlling the AI in terms of getting it to generate what I was envisioning in my mind. Through prompt engineering I managed to considerably improve the outputs but it was still incredibly difficult.

Overall I was quite happy with the final products considering the limitations of the model:

1. A teaser trailer for a Batman Game based in London
2. A teaser trailer for a Slenderman vs Spiderman movie (the original direction was to show a fight scene in the train carriage but the AI isn't capable of generating such videos yet. Instead, while charging at Slenderman, Spiderman falls over and embarrasses himself)
